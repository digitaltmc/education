## Basic

[A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1). A basic tutorial for Golang. Go through this.

[Learn Golang + GraphQL + Relay](https://wehavefaces.net/learn-golang-graphql-relay-1-e59ea174a902). We will use GraphQL for our API in future.

[Go 1.11 Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). We use "Go Modules" to manage packages. Other options are "dep" or Makefile. But we stick to official one.

TBC:
Go with MongoDB
Go unit test
